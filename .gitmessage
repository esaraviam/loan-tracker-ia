# Type should be one of the following:
# - feat: A new feature
# - fix: A bug fix
# - docs: Documentation only changes
# - style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
# - refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
# - perf: A code change that improves performance
# - test: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
# - build: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
# - ci: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts
# - chore: Other changes that don't modify src or test files
#
# Scope is optional and can be anything specifying the place of the commit change.
# Examples: auth, loans, dashboard, api, ui, etc.
#
# Subject should use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
# Don't capitalize the first letter
# No dot (.) at the end
#
# Body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior
#
# Footer should contain any information about Breaking Changes and is also the place to
# reference GitHub issues that this commit closes
#
# Breaking Changes should start with the word BREAKING CHANGE: with a space or two newlines.
# The rest of the commit message is then used for this.
